## **i. Evaluation Criteria for IBM Sellers and Business Partners**

To receive a Level 3 badge (**IBM Event Automation for Technical Sales Intermediate**), IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 skills requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated —differs depending on job role.

!!! note "IBM SELLERS"
        
        IBM sellers must develop and record a **Stand & Deliver** presentation, which will be uploaded to the IBM Stand & Deliver platform for evaluation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera.
        
        IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab.

!!! tip "BUSINESS PARTNERS"

        Business partners must pass a **skills evaluation quiz** after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Participants must pass the quiz with a grade of 80% or higher.

        The quiz questions will ask you about on-screen text or descriptions that come up as you work through the lab guide. Answers to quiz questions can only be determined by carefully following the instructions of the hands-on lab.


Take note that any materials marked as `OPTIONAL` are **not** evaluated for Level 3 badges.
        
- IBM Sellers are *not* required to include optional sections in their Stand & Deliver
        
- Business partners are *not* tested on the contents of optional sections

## **ii. *IBMer* Stand & Deliver assessment**

!!! warning "IBMers — SUBMIT RECORDINGS HERE"

        Submit your Stand & Deliver recording online using IBM YourLearning:
        
        <a href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/ISND-SALESENABLEMENT-2403071100" target="_blank">https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/ISND-SALESENABLEMENT-2403071100</a>

The evaluation criteria described below **only applies to IBMers**, who must record a Stand & Deliver to receive credit for this Level 3 course. By default, IBMers will be evaluated by their First Line Manager (FLM) — although they may request another manager to evaluate their Stand & Deliver, if appropriate. Instructions on how to submit a Stand & Deliver are included within the activity on YourLearning.

IBM Sellers need to include **all** seven of the following elements in their Stand & Deliver recording to receive a Level 3 badge. FLMs are to use these requirements as part of their evaluation criteria.

1. Seller articulated their client's pain point(s) and the value proposition of using *IBM Event Automation* and *IBM Cloud Pak for Integration*.

2. Seller highlighted use cases for *IBM Event Automation*. It is recommended that sellers address the challenges of real-time access for meeting client demands — and how event-led integration solutions from IBM can overcome these obstacles.

3. Seller must demonstrate how to take existing IBM MQ message queues and publish those as Kafka-based event streams using *IBM Cloud Pak for Integration* and *IBM Event Streams*.

4. Seller must utilize *IBM Event Endpoint Management* to import the newly-created event streams topics and show how the service provides a self-service catalog for managing those topics.

5. Seller must show how *IBM Event Processing* can correlate any newly-created customer accounts with first-time purchase orders that total over $100 USD in value. They should include in this demonstration an explanation about how to define event sources, destinations, filters, and `JOIN` interval operations using the no-code authoring canvas.

6. Seller must connect historical data to the `LOYALTY.APP` application endpoint to validate the end-to-end configurations made so far and simulate how "live" event data is being processed by the IBM Event Automation suite. Sellers should use the `Run > Include Historical` test execution inside *IBM Event Processing* to demonstrate this.

6. Seller closed the demonstration with a call to action for their client that could include: a workshop, a deeper dive into the product meeting, or Proof of Experience (PoX) engagement.
