## **i. Using Event Processing no-code editors for configuration**

Focus Corporation's marketing department now has a fully configured, self-service catalog of event stream data available within **IBM Event Endpoint Management (EEM)**.

At this stage, work will transition from the integration team to the domain of the marketing team. Focus' marketing team will utilize **IBM Event Processing (EP)** to correlate any newly-created customer accounts with first-time purchase orders that total over $100 USD in value. Furthermore, these correlated transactions will need to be identified within a 24-hour window of when they occur.

If these conditions can be met, the marketing team will be able to create an actionable plan for putting high-value promotional offers in front of first-time customers in a timely manner — which should translate to more sales revenue through Focus' digital storefront.

1. With your web browser, access the **IBM Event Processing** dashboard.

    Dismiss any welcome screens or tutorials that are prompted after first logging in by clicking the **Hide Welcome**^[A]^ text in the bottom-left corner of the interface.

---

2. In the bottom-right corner of the page, click the blue **Create**^[B]^ to begin defining a new *flow*.

    <br/>

    !!! note inline "EVENT PROCESSING FLOWS"

        An event processing flow ingests a stream of events, analyzes that input, and takes automatic actions (defined by the user) in response to those conditions.

        A flow begins with one or multiple event sources which represent inbound events. For the purposes of this demonstration, you will leverage the `ORDERS` event stream that was defined in the previous module. You will do so using EP's intuitive, no-code authoring canvas.

    - Click **Next**^[C]^

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-9.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}
    
---

9. The *Topic Selection* tab needs additional information to configure the node.

    - Available topics will already be displayed within the configuration tool
    
    - Under the *Topic selection* header, click the button next to the `ORDERS`^[A]^ topic to select it

    - Click **Next**^[B]^

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-10.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

10. The *Message Format* needs details about the event formatting.

    - *Message format*: set to `JSON`

    - Set the *JSON sample message* field to the value stored below:

    !!! note inline end ""

        Note that this is the same sample schema you supplied when configuring the event source within EEM in Module 2.

    ``` json
    {
    "quantity": 9,

## **iv. Filtering event sources to match specific criteria**

With the event source fully configured within EP, you can now begin tailoring the event processing flow to filter on orders where the value exceeds $100 USD.

---

22. Scroll down within the list of nodes and actions on the left-side interface until you locate the **Filter** node.

    - Click and hold the **Filter**^[A]^ node, then drag it to the authoring canvas on the right
    
    - Position it to the right side of the `Orders` node

---

23. The output terminal for `Orders` needs to be connected as input to the `filter_1` node.

    - With your mouse pointer, hover over the `Orders` node and take note of the grey dot (labelled *Output Port*^[B]^) at the right edge of the tile

    - Click and hold the *Output Port* (right-most) of `Orders` and **drag** it to the *Input Port*^[C]^ (left-most edge) of `filter_1`, then release your hold to complete the circuit

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-23.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

24. With the `Orders` event source node connected to the `filter_1` operation node, you must utilize the Filter node's expression builder to remove orders that are *less than* $100 USD in value. This will allow the marketing team's application to target only first-time customers with spending patterns of $100 USD or more.

    Hover over the `filter_1` node with your mouse pointer and click the **Edit**^[D]^ (pencil) icon.

---

25. Within the *Details* tab, specify the value of **Node name** as `FilterLargeOrders`

    When ready, click **Next**.

---

26. The *Define filter* tab will load next. To the right of the **Filter expression** field, click the **Assistant**^[A]^ drop-down menu to expose additional options.

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-27a.png){: loading=lazy width="300"}

---

27. Event Processing's expression builder will guide you in defining the filter.

    - Property to filter on: `price`

    - Condition: `Is greater than`

    - Value: `100`

    - Click the **Add to expression** button

    - The expression builder will automatically translate your statements into a syntactically-correct filter statement: ` 'price' > 100 `

    - Click the **Configure**^[B]^ button at the bottom of the panel to finalize the filter configuration

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-27b.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

## **v. Performing a JOIN across two event sources**

The marketing team needs to "JOIN" the filtered `Order` stream data to records of `New Customers` in order to correctly identify first-time purchasers that placed an order for over $100 USD in the last 24 hours. Use EP's authoring canvas to carry out the necessary JOIN operation.

---

28. Back on the canvas for `NewCustomerLargeOrders`, scroll down along the left-hand interface until you locate the **Interval Join**^[A]^ node.

    Drag and drop this node^[B]^ to the far right-hand edge of the authoring canvas.

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-28.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

29. With your cursor, hover over the `New Customers` output terminal and locate the *Output Port* (grey) button.

    - Click and hold the `New Customers` *Output Port*^[A]^ edge and **drag** this to the *Input Port*^[B]^ edge of the newly-created `intervalJoin_1` node

    - Release your cursor to finalize the circuit

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-29.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

30. Repeat the process, this time connecting the `FilterLargeOrders` node's *Output Port*^[A]^ to the `intervalJoin_1` node's *Input Port*^[B]^.

    At this stage, the input of `intervalJoin_1` should be connected to the outputs of *both* the `FilterLargeOrders` and `New Customers` nodes.

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-30.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

31. The JOIN node must now be configured to correlate events based on a shared `customerid` field within the two event streams (`New Customers` and pre-filtered `Orders`).

    With your cursor, hover over the `intervalJoin_1` node and click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.

---

32. Within the *Details* tab, set **Node name**^[A]^ equal to `DetectNewCustomerLargeOrders`

    When ready, click **Next**^[B]^.

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-32.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

33. Within the *Join conditions* tab, activate the expression builder by click the **Assistant**^[A]^ drop-down menu. Set the following properties:

    - Specify property from 'New Customers': `customerid`

    - Specify property from 'FilterLargeOrders': `customerid`

    - When ready, click **Add to expression**^[B]^

    - The syntactically-correct JOIN expression will be expressed under the *Define events* field: `'New Customers'.'customerid' = 'FilterLargeOrders'.'customerid'`

    - After you have reviewed the JOIN condition, click **Next**^[C]^

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-33a.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

    ![](_attachments/3-33b.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

!!! note "TRIGGERING EVENTS AND DETECTED EVENTS"

    Two concepts are important to understand at this time: *Triggering events* and *Detected events*.

    - Since the `New Customer` sign-up event must logically occur before a purchase, it is considered a *triggering event*

    - Therefore, when a signal for an `Order` purchase of over $100 (the *detected event*) is received, the JOIN logic condition will be triggered for the two event streams

34. Under the *Time window condition*, you can define the time interval "window" where detected events are considered viable for a promotional offer from the marketing team. To meet the criteria, a purchase of over $100 USD must be made by a first-time customer within a 24 hour window of creating an account.

    - Look for the **Event to detect**^[A]^ field and select the `FilterLargeOrders (event_time)` option from the drop-down menu

    - A *Preview* visualization of the time window interval is rendered within the panel — for now, with no adjustments made, this will appear as a vertical bar at 0 (on the X-axis)

    - Scroll down further to reveal additional attributes to edit

    - *Event to set the time window*: `New Customers (event-time)`

    - *Offset from event to start the time window*: `0` `HOUR(S)`

    - *Offset from event to end the time window*^[B]^: `24` `HOUR(S)`

    - When ready, click **Next**^[C]^

    <br/>
    ![](_attachments/3-34.png){: loading=lazy width="600"}

---

The JOIN node's output will be a combination of fields from both the filtered `Orders` and `New Customers` events streams.

Before finalizing the interval join, you need to clean up the output so that duplicate fields (like `customerid` and `event_time`) are not included from the JOIN operation. You have the option of renaming or removing the duplicate fields — but for the sake of this demonstration, you will be removing the fields.

---

35. Within the *Output properties* tab, locate the `customerid`^[A]^ field. There are **two** (duplicate) copies of the same field at this time. Your objective will be to delete **ONE** of the two duplicate records, where the *Source* is labelled as `New Customers`. Preserve the record where *Source* is labelled as `FilterLargeOrders`.

    - Click the round `—` sign to the left of the first `customerid` row, where the *Source* is labelled as "New Customers", to remove the duplicate

    - The result will be only one copy of the `customerid` field in the table
    
    - The red text (*Must be unique*) underlining the field will disappear from the table

    <br/>

    !!! warning inline end "ONLY REMOVE DUPLICATES WHERE SOURCE == NEW CUSTOMERS"

        When reviewing *Output properties* for duplicate fields, take note of the table's **Source** column. Duplicates will be produced by both the `New Customers` and `FilterLargeOrders` nodes. Only remove duplicates where the **Source** is listed as `New Customers`.

    ![](_attachments/3-35a.png){: loading=lazy width="400"}

---

36. Repeat the procedure for the `event_time` field, which is also duplicated by the JOIN:

    - Delete the `event_time` row where the *Source* column is labelled as "New Customers"

    - With all duplicates removed from the table, the **Configure**^[A]^ button will now be highlighted in blue and selectable

    - Click the **Configure** button to finalize the interval join configuration

    <br/>
